Classify Chip and CPU/GPU core by examining the *title* and *content*.

Here are some steps you can follow.

STEP 1. READ THE TITLE AND CONTENT.
STEP 2. CLASSIFY THE CHIP FROM THE TITLE AND CONTENT.
* YOU CAN HAVE THE FOLLOWING CHIPS
 > INTEL
 > M1 PRO
 > M1 MAX
 > M2 PRO
 > M2 MAX

STEP 3. CLASSIFY THE CPU/GPU CORE FROM THE TITLE AND CONTENT.
* YOU CAN HAVE CPU/GPU CORE FOR EACH CHIP
> INTEL : N/A
> M1 PRO : CPU = 8, 10, GPU = 14, 16
> M1 MAX : CPU = 10 GPU = 24, 32
> M2 PRO : CPU = 10, 12, GPU = 16, 19
> M2 MAX : CPU = 12, GPU = 30, 38

IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE CPU/GPU CORE, PUT DEFAULT VALUE FROM THE FOLLOWING TABLE.
> INTEL : N/A
> M1 PRO : CPU = 8, GPU = 14
> M1 MAX : CPU = 10, GPU = 24
> M2 PRO : CPU = 10, GPU = 16
> M2 MAX : CPU = 12, GPU = 30

title: {title}
content: {content}

YOU SHOULD ANSWER BY FOLLOWING FORMAT.
CHIP = M1 PRO
CPU_CORE = 8
GPU_CORE = 14

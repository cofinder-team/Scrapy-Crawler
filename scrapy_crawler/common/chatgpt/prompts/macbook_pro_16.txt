Classify CPU/GPU core by examining the *title* and *content*.

Here are some steps you can follow.

STEP 1. read the TITLE and CONTENT.
STEP 2. classify Macbook CHIP from the TITLE or CONTENT.
* YOU MUST SELECT ONE CHIP FROM THE FOLLOWING TABLE.
 > INTEL
 > M1 PRO
 > M1 MAX
 > M2 PRO
 > M2 MAX

STEP 3. classify CPU/GPU core from the TITLE or CONTENT.
* YOU MUST SELECT ONE CPU/GPU CORE FROM THE FOLLOWING TABLE.
> INTEL : N/A
> M1 PRO : CPU = 10, GPU = 16
> M1 MAX : CPU = 10, GPU = 24, 32
> M2 PRO : CPU = 12, GPU = 19
> M2 MAX : CPU = 12, GPU = 30, 38

IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE CPU/GPU CORE, PUT DEFAULT VALUE FROM THE FOLLOWING TABLE.
> INTEL : N/A
> M1 PRO : CPU = 10, GPU = 16
> M1 MAX : CPU = 10, GPU = 24
> M2 PRO : CPU = 12, GPU = 19
> M2 MAX : CPU = 12, GPU = 30

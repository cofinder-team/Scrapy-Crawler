Classify CPU/GPU core and RAM/SSD capacity by examining the *title* and *content*.

Here are some steps you can follow.

STEP 1. READ THE TITLE AND CONTENT.
STEP 2. CLASSIFY THE CHIP FROM THE TITLE AND CONTENT.
* YOU CAN HAVE THE FOLLOWING CHIPS
 > INTEL
 > M1
 > M2

STEP 3. CLASSIFY THE CPU/GPU CORE FROM THE TITLE AND CONTENT.
* YOU CAN HAVE CPU/GPU CORE FOR EACH CHIP
> INTEL : N/A
> M1 : CPU = 8, GPU = 8
> M2 : CPU = 8, GPU = 10

IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE CPU/GPU CORE, PUT DEFAULT VALUE FROM THE FOLLOWING TABLE.
> INTEL : N/A
> M1 : CPU = 8, GPU = 8
> M2 : CPU = 8, GPU = 10

---
title: {title}
content: {content}
---

YOU SHOULD ANSWER BY FOLLOWING FORMAT.
CHIP = M1
CPU_CORE = 8
GPU_CORE = 8
